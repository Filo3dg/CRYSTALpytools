    "The basic definitions of a single vibrational mode at the given q point. It can be used for both HA and QHA levels of theory. Mode objects cannot be used for writing data output and calculating the thermodyanmics of the whole system. It can only be used to calculate the thermodynamics of a single phonon. Therefore, a 'shell' (e.g., 'Harmonic' object, see below) is needed to sum up individual phonons. For simplicity, only the attributes for HA are kept.\n",

    "Class Harmonic can calculate the HA thermodynamics at a set of q points in order to sample various cell sizes. As a test case illustrating the effectiveness of this, a phonon dispersion calculation is performed based on the $\\Gamma$ point frequency data of Form I paracetamol crystal. `SCELPHONO` is set to be 1 to save computation time.\n",

    "The reference data is 'f1-disp.out' - Frequencies at $\\Gamma$ are different from the 'f1freq-r0.out' case due to unknown reasons. In this case, nqpoint = 140, nmode = 240, natom = 80. The temperature range is set to be 0K ~ 300K, with intervals of 20K. Since negative frequencies presents, warning messages will be printed. \n",
